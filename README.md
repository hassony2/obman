# Download required files

## Download dataset images and data

- Request the dataset on the [ObMan webpage](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/obman/data/). Note that the data falls under the following [license](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/obman/data/license.html)
- Once you have approved the license. You then need to send an e-mail to yana.hasson.inria@gmail.com with "ObMan data request" as subject.
- unzip obman.zip to /path/to/obman
- Your dataset structure should look like

```
obman/
  test/
    rgb/
    rgb_obj/
    meta/
    ...
  val/
    rgb/
    rgb_obj/
    meta/
    ...
```

## Download object meshes

- Download object models from ShapeNet
  - Create an account on [shapenet.org](https://www.shapenet.org)
  - Download models from [download page](https://www.shapenet.org/download/shapenetcore)


# Download code

`git clone https://github.com/hassony2/obman`

`cd obman`

# Load samples

`python readataset --root /path/to/obman --shapenet_root /path/to/ShapeNetCore.v2 --split test --viz`

Options you might be interested in `--segment` which keeps only the foreground `--mini_factor 0.01` to load only 1% of the data (to speed-up loading)

# Preprocess shapenet objects for training

Sample points on the external surface of the object:

`python shapenet_samplepoints.py`

## Visualizations

### Hand object and mesh in camera coordinates

### Projected in pixel space

Hand vertices in blue, object vertices in red.
